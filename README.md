# video_uploader

Uploads videos to a url of choice.

To run the script:
* First install marathon script manager for Swift with brew "brew install marathon-swift"
* Run the script without downloading it, using "marathon run https://github.com/oshtman/video_uploader.git"
  or by installing it as a binary and run through the terminal "marathon install https://github.com/oshtman/video_uploader.git"
  
  Currently the scripts needs to be modified to match individual needs (e.g. endpoint, potential access-tokens)
