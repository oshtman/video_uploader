# video_uploader

Uploads videos to a url of choice.

To run the script:
* First install marathon script manager for Swift with brew 
```swift
brew install marathon-swift
```
* Run the script without downloading it, using 

```swift
marathon run https://github.com/oshtman/video_uploader.git
```
* or install it as a binary and run through the terminal
```swift
marathon install https://github.com/oshtman/video_uploader.git
```
Currently the scripts needs to be modified to match individual needs (e.g. endpoint, potential access-tokens)
